# Spatial Workbench — Vision

Spatial Workbench is a quiet, trustworthy GIS workspace designed for **agent-led problem solving**.

## North Star
Give an agent a task. It finds the right tools, runs them, and returns a clear answer. The human never needs to know GIS details to trust the result.

## Principles
- **Agent-first:** Tasks are expressed in plain language; the system chooses tools and parameters.
- **Clarity over complexity:** Outputs read like confident conclusions, not GIS jargon.
- **Trust by default:** Results are understandable at a glance, with minimal friction.
- **Depth on demand:** When needed, you can inspect maps, tool history, and data provenance.
- **Quiet reliability:** It solves problems without fanfare, and does not require a power user.

## What “success” looks like
- A non‑GIS user can ask a spatial question and get a correct, explainable answer.
- The agent can discover tools and run them without human guidance.
- Outputs inspire confidence through clear summaries and sensible defaults.
- Detailed artifacts exist for auditability, but the happy path is fast and simple.

## Product shape
- **Tool discovery API** for agents to select the right actions.
- **Stable state API** so agents can read, run, and verify results.
- **Clean ToolResult contract** so outputs are consistent and composable.
- **Minimal, mobile‑friendly UI** for human oversight without GIS expertise.

## Why it matters
Spatial questions shouldn’t require a GIS expert. Spatial Workbench makes advanced GIS capability feel like a calm, reliable utility: ask, answer, done.
